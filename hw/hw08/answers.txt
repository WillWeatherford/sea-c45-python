Homework 8

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)


Problem 2:

GC-content: 0.4302926296296296


Problem 3:

NameError: name 'linenum' is not defined
By commenting out the assignment of variables "linenum" and "seq",
those variables do not exist when called by name later in the program.
Therefore the program raises a NameError because a non-defined variable
is being called.

If this line was commented out:
gc_count = 0
The program would raise a NameError on line 64 when the variable
gc_count is referenced before assignment.


Problem 4:

AT-content: 0.568993851852


Problem 5:

C-content: 0.217745481481
G-content: 0.212547148148
A-content: 0.285232851852
T-content: 0.283761


Problem 6:

The program counts base pairs in several steps.
First it takes every 4th line and assumes that all characters on that line are
base piars.
It adds each 4th line into a very long string -- the "seq" variable.
Then it analyses the base pairs based on the percentage of each letter among
the total number of characters in "seq".

The "total_count" variable is increased for each character in "seq"; therefore
the length of seq == total_count in all files.

However, among the CGAT characters are also "N" characters, which according
to Wikipedia indicate an unspecified amiguous base pair which may be any of the
4: C, G, A or T.

So the sum total of C,G,A and T will be less than "seq" since "seq" also
includes "N"s.

I'm not sure whether it would be correct or useful for a geneticist to include
the "N" characters as part of the total CGAT count, since they are ambigous.

I will update the GC content calculation to use the sum total of C,G,A and T,
instead of the length of "seq" or the value of "total_count".
