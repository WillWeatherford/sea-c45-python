##### Will

Hello, my name is **Will Weatherford**. I live in Ballard with my wife, and I'll be turning 32 on Friday.

I started learning Python almost 2 years ago using free online classes and have been programming off and and on since then, mostly learning by working on my own projects and troubleshooting them. I work full time in sales for a small IT services company but I'd much rather program for a living.

Here are some more things about me:
1. I play ultimate frisbee in the [DiscNW](http://www.discnw.org) rec leagues
2. I've lived in Australia and Hawaii
3. I'm a big time board gamer. My favorite games include:
..*Dominion
..*Race For The Galaxy
..*Puerto Rico
..*Blokus
4. I'm editing this document using the bash command "vi"

######That's it for now. See you in class!
